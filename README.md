## Data Set

[Adult Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Question

Does the `maritalStatus` of a person afftect the salary `class` of the person, i.e if a person earns above $50,000 or not.

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis is that `maritalStatus` will not affect the salary class of a person.

## Plan of Action

Identify the variables that are relevent to the problem and filter the unwanted variables out. Summarise the resultant dataframe obtained to identify the number of records in different categories. Visualise the data to identify if there is a relation between the the `maritalStatus` and the salary class. Also, visualize the data to identify if there are any other variables that are responsible for the behaviour in data.
